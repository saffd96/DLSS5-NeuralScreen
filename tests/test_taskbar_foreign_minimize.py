"""A foreign window being minimised must not open our menu (issue #96).

Report (Saymoin): "I minimize and restore any other program's window, and
after that NeuralScreen unfolds by itself." Measured on the bench, the message
stream makes the two cases identical:

  * a real click on our taskbar button arrives as WM_NCACTIVATE(1);
  * the fallback activation Windows hands our 1x1 window right after ANOTHER
    window is minimised arrives as the SAME WM_NCACTIVATE(1),
    with the cursor over the taskbar and our window in the foreground.

The old guard saw `wparam == 1` + cursor over the taskbar + we are foreground
and opened the menu - for a window the user never touched. The state around
the message is what separates them: a real click leaves the previous
application alive, the fallback leaves it minimised (measured with a live
probe, _work/probe_taskbar_activation.py).

Checked here, with a REAL foreign window on its own thread and a real
SW_MINIMIZE:

* minimising a foreign window that owns the foreground emits NOTHING;
* an activation while the previous app is alive still opens the menu (the
  click path must not be lost while fixing the false one);
* the second click on our already-active button still works (issue #93:
  "залипает" - the second click was dead without this path);
* SC_MINIMIZE/SC_RESTORE from the taskbar button still open the menu.
