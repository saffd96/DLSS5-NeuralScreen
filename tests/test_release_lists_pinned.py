"""The release contract's own lists must not be editable in silence (audit H6).

MANDATORY_FILES and REQUIRED_RUNTIME_ARTIFACTS drive two gates that are
self-referential:

* membership is what makes an untracked file acceptable to
  _assert_mandatory_inputs, and
* membership is what keeps a file that _skip() would drop inside the package
  (`rel not in mandatory` in _package_paths).

Nothing else records them. runtime-manifest.json carries the resulting
inventory, so after a regeneration everything agrees - the digest, the file
count, the ZIP, both SHA256SUMS, the verifier's inventory check and the Git
binding. A check of the manifest at HEAD shows no key mentioning "mandatory",
and verify_github.py has no copy of either list to cross-check the builder
against (grep MANDATORY: 0 hits).

So removing one line ships a release without an input the contract calls
mandatory, with a self-consistent and fully verified manifest. The concrete
candidate is already in the list: native/libraries/README.md is dropped by
_skip() and enters the package only because of its mandatory entry - delete
that entry and the file leaves the release and the inventory, and every gate
still passes. The fixture tests in tests/test_release_contract.py build the
contract from those same two lists, so they cannot notice either.

This test holds the lists to their expected content. It is deliberately a
literal second copy: the point is that changing the contract has to be a
deliberate edit in two places, and the review sees it.

Checked here:

* the exact set of MANDATORY_FILES, including the entry that only the list
  keeps in the package;
* the exact set of REQUIRED_RUNTIME_ARTIFACTS;
* every mandatory path is really in the repository (a typo would otherwise
  fail only at release time, on a clean checkout);
* the two lists agree about the runtime binaries they both name;
* THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES and RUNTIME_MANIFEST keep the names the builder pins.
