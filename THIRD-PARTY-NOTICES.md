# Third-party notices

NeuralScreen is distributed with third-party components. This file is a
notice and attribution index; the corresponding license texts shipped with
the components remain controlling.

## NVIDIA components

The package currently contains two different classes of NVIDIA software:

- `nvngx_dlssg.dll` 310.9.1.0 is an NVIDIA-signed public DLSS-G
  redistributable and remains subject to NVIDIA's applicable terms.
- `nvngx_dlssnr.dll` 310.8.0 is a leaked, non-public DLSS-NR build. The project
  has not documented a grant that permits redistributing this file. Its
  presence in an archive, an attribution notice, or a research-only label does
  not create that permission. This remains an unresolved distribution risk.

NGX headers and import libraries remain subject to their SDK terms. All NVIDIA
files remain NVIDIA property. NeuralScreen is independent and is not affiliated
with or endorsed by NVIDIA.

## Spout2

The package contains Spout2 runtime libraries and integration code.

## Python and bundled Python packages

The package contains CPython and selected runtime files from these projects:

- PyAV / FFmpeg
- NumPy
- OpenCV
- Pillow
- pygame
- DXcam
- MSS
- pystray
- comtypes
- colorama, packaging, pywin32-ctypes, six and typing-extensions

These components remain under their respective licenses. Package metadata and
license files included in the bundled runtime are preserved in the release
where supplied upstream. FFmpeg licensing depends on the options used to build
the bundled libraries; recipients should consult the bundled PyAV/FFmpeg
license materials before redistribution.

## Fonts

IBM Plex fonts are distributed under the SIL Open Font License 1.1. The full
license text is included as `fonts/OFL.txt`.

## No relicensing

Nothing in the NeuralScreen license grants additional rights to third-party
components. Names and trademarks belong to their respective owners.
