"""The mss fallback must not fabricate a monitor identity.

ScreenCapture._open_mss used to set self.devicename from the POSITIONAL
index - "\\\\.\\DISPLAY{monitor_idx + 1}". DXGI output order and DISPLAYn
numbering are not guaranteed to agree (the module's own docstring says so),
so on an Optimus machine the guessed name can point at ANOTHER monitor: the
overlay origin, NS_OUTPUT and the identity saved to the config all follow
the guess while the capture itself is on the right display.

Expected: the reported devicename is the one the opened monitor really has,
or an empty name (which _apply_monitor_env handles). [audit ui-display]

The earlier version checked the SOURCE TEXT for the synthesis line. Both of
its guards were defeated by a formatting change: writing the same bug as
`DISPLAY{monitor_idx+1}` (no spaces) passed, because the literal it looked
for was gone and it fell back to a "likely fixed" NOTE (audit: WEAK). This
version drives the real _open_mss with a fake mss module and asserts on the
behaviour - the devicename and the resolution the object ends up with.
