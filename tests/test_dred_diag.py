"""The worker logs its DRED/device-removed diagnostics at startup.

Issue #1 (Win10 TDR) died with only "code 6" in the log - no reason, no
breadcrumbs. The worker now enables DRED breadcrumbs when the OS supports
them and logs the outcome either way; on a removed device BeginCommands
logs GetDeviceRemovedReason plus breadcrumbs. This test checks the startup
half: the log must contain a DRED line (enabled or unavailable-with-hr),
and the worker must still run NR afterwards.

Run:  runtime\\python.exe test_dred_diag.py
