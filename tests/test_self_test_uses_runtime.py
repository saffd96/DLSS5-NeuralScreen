"""--test must evaluate through the same runtime that created the feature.

`--test` drives the worker with no client and reports "N/300 evaluates
succeeded". It reported **0/300** for a long time while the live pipeline was
perfectly healthy, because the two halves of the self-test disagreed:

* the feature was created through the DLSSNR runtime (`g_nr_create`, which is
  `NVSDK_NGX_D3D12_CreateFeature` from nvngx_dlssnr.dll);
* it was evaluated through the NGX CORE wrapper (`NGX_D3D12_EVALUATE_DLSS_EXT`
  from the NGX headers) - a different implementation that knows nothing about a
  handle the runtime owns, so every evaluate answered 0xBAD00004
  (FeatureNotFound).

The live path never had this problem: `EvaluateVideo` has always called
`g_nr_evaluate`. The self-test now does too, and this checks the source so the
two cannot drift apart again:

1. `Evaluate` calls `g_nr_evaluate` and does NOT call the core wrapper;
2. the core wrappers (`SafeEvaluateDLSS`/`SafeCreateDLSS`) are gone - their
   only caller was the broken pair, and leaving them invites the same mistake;
3. the parameter block is shared (`ApplyNrEvalParams`), so the self-test sets
   the same names the live path sets instead of its own subset;
4. `--test` fills the shipped profile (`SetTestVideoParams`) - the read-back
   check compares against real values, and an all-zero profile would report a
   contract failure that exists only in the self-test.

Provable by mutation: point `Evaluate` back at the core wrapper, or drop the
profile call, and the matching check goes red.
