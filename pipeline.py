"""The pipeline's lifecycle: build it, tear it down, point it somewhere else.

Everything the program does between frames. A pipeline is built for ONE frame
size, and the worker, the shared memory, the overlay and every negotiated
channel are built for that size - so changing what is captured (another
monitor, one window, a different work resolution) means tearing the whole
thing down and building it again. That is why these six belong together, and
why they were the hardest part of main() to reach: they rebind everything.

Two rules the hard way:

  * the work resolution and the guides change TOGETHER. Assigning one and not
    the other sent motion of the old size to a worker reading exactly
    new_w*new_h*4 bytes, and the pipeline hung waiting for bytes that never
    came.
  * a window's size and its position are different problems. A move is a
    SetWindowPos; a resize is a rebuild, and it waits for the size to settle
    first - rebuilding on every pixel of a drag would be unusable.
