"""The automatic worker revive must survive the NR-OFF transition.

A transient worker failure arms one automatic revive: worker_failed=True and
next_auto_revive=+30 s. The revive itself is read at the top of main's loop,
guarded by an earlier call in the same iteration:

    low_cost_off = pipeline.sync_low_cost_off(st)
    if st.worker_failed:
        if st.next_auto_revive and time.monotonic() >= st.next_auto_revive:

Entering the OFF branch with the worker already shut down, sync_low_cost_off
re-asserted worker_failed and ZEROED next_auto_revive. The deadline read one
line later was 0, the loop took the low-cost branch and continued for the rest
of the session: the revive never fired. In the default configuration (FG off,
no recording) that is every time - the path that exists precisely for "leave
the user with NR off until they press Num1" was the one path it never worked
on, while the log announced "auto-revive in 30s".

Checked here against the real pipeline.sync_low_cost_off:

* the arm survives the OFF transition in the default configuration, so
  main's revive still reads it;
* a worker that really did die is still marked failed - the OFF transition
  must not claim a healthy worker either;
* the arm is cleared where it is consumed, and nowhere else in the OFF path.
