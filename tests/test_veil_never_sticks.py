"""The mode-switch veil must never outlive its transition (issues #89/#96).

Reported twice: "I launched 1.13.1, but the problem persists - the window
becomes invisible, then it may reappear to disappear". The veil is the frozen
picture with the assembling mark that covers a pipeline rebuild. It is taken
down by exit_switch_mode() followed by a drawn frame - and every one of those
call sites sits in the frame-receiving path.

With NR OFF the loop never reaches that path: it takes the low-cost branch and
calls only _service_idle_overlay(). A rebuild started from the menu in that
state (Spout2 / HDR / motion backend / monitor / GPU) raises the veil, no frame
ever arrives, and while the veil is up draw_overlay returns BEFORE painting the
menu - so the screen stays frozen under the mark and the interface is gone.

Checked here, with the real Display and no window:

* reproducing the idle sequence with no exit call leaves the veil up (the bug);
* the idle branch's own two calls take it down - the fade route with the menu
  visible, the immediate drop with it closed;
* the hold cap brings it down even when nobody draws and nobody exits: the
  backstop for a veil whose frame never came;
* the idle service really does make those calls - read out of main.py, because
  it is a closure inside main() and cannot be imported.
