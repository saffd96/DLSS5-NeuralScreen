"""The "Save as" dialog is actually callable - the struct fill does not raise.

This is the test that was missing. `ask_save_path` builds an OPENFILENAME and
calls GetSaveFileNameW; the struct fill raised TypeError on every machine
(`ofn.lpstrFile = buf` - a c_wchar array into an LPWSTR field), the wrapper
caught it, and every screenshot went silently to the fallback folder. The
only evidence was one line in the log, which is where it sat until a user
attached their log to issue #30.

Nothing here opens a dialog: the struct is built by `_save_dialog_struct`,
which is exactly the part that broke, and the fallback path is checked
through `ask_save_path` with a deliberately impossible request.
