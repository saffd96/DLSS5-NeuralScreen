"""A crash in the main loop must land in the log with its traceback.

A user on an RTX 3060 sent a log whose whole account of the failure was one
line:

    [main] ERROR: <built-in function get> returned a result with an exception set

That is a SystemError - some C call had already left an error indicator set
and the next builtin tripped over it - so the line names the messenger and
not the cause. With no traceback there was nothing to work from, and the
reporter ended up guessing at a fix and sending it as a patch (issue #41,
PR #42). A whole round trip lost to a missing traceback.

So: the loop's handler prints the traceback, and this pins it.

The handler is located by its OWN anchor - the `[main] ERROR` line it is
required to print - not by "the next two-space-indented block after any
`except Exception`". The earlier regex ran from main.py:429 to main.py:1189,
a 43,670-character span containing every other handler in main(), so a
traceback printed anywhere in it satisfied the check (audit: WEAK). Anchor
on the marker, then read outward from it.
