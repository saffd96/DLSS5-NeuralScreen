"""The compatibility guard must not re-hash the runtime on every call (audit H2).

`pipeline.require_compatibility` is a fail-closed guard called before every
production worker start, and it delegates to `compatibility_runtime.require_pass`,
which builds a fresh key every time:

    current_key = build_key(st)
    if current_key.digest != passed_key.digest: raise ...

build_key hashes the 165,840,496-byte `native/nvngx_dlssnr.dll` twice on the
same call - once as `runtime_sha256` (CompatibilityKey.from_files) and once
through `_runtime_route` -> `_fingerprint`, which resolves to the same file.

Measured on this machine: sha256 of that file 93 ms, build_key 355 ms cold /
184 ms warm. Those call sites run on a user action, not once at startup:
rebuild_pipeline (every monitor switch, window switch, Spout toggle, HDR
toggle, motion-backend change, GPU switch), the do_restart fallback, the
auto-revive, the worker-lost paths and the manual NR revive. The main loop is
single-threaded, so each one blocks it for ~0.2-0.4 s of pure file hashing on
top of the rebuild the user is already waiting for - the overlay does not pump
and the hotkeys do not drain.

The guard itself must stay: it is what refuses a worker whose runtime changed
underneath a PASS. What it must not do is repeat work whose answer cannot have
changed. Checked here:

* an unchanged file is hashed once, however many times the key is built;
* the cached digest equals a fresh hash of the same bytes (never a stale or
  wrong value);
* a file that CHANGED is hashed again and the new digest differs - the whole
  point of the guard;
* a fake filesystem (the test seam) is never cached: every caller that passes
  one keeps its exact behaviour.
