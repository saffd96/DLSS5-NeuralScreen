"""The bundle must say how the program was configured, and the log must date it.

Four support packages (19.09) could not answer the questions they were sent to
answer:

* `diagnostics.json` carried no configuration at all - "No configuration or
  environment dump is collected" - so a report could not say whether frame
  generation was on, at which multiplier, or which motion backend was running.
  Every evidence table for those packages ends with a list of settings that had
  to be asked for by hand;
* the log header carried a time of day but no date, so a bundle could only be
  placed in time by reading a screenshot's file name;
* the header named the version, the GPU and the driver but not one switch, so
  "frame generation does not work" left no way to tell whether the feature had
  been on from the start or switched on halfway through.

Checked here:

1. the settings section exists in the report and carries the product keys;
2. it drops what must not travel: hotkeys (a user's own bindings) and the
   screenshot/recording directories (paths) - even though they are in the
   config the section is built from;
3. an unknown key is dropped rather than trusted (the allow-list is the
   contract, not the caller's dict);
4. a value that is not a scalar is dropped, and a long string is dropped - the
   section is a dozen scalars, not an unbounded part of the report;
5. the environment header prints a date, and the switches line names the
   product switches;
6. the bundle caller passes the live config, not the file on disk.

Provable by mutation: add `hotkeys` to the allow-list and check 2 fails; drop
the date from the header and check 5 fails.
