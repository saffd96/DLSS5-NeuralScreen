"""The worker-failure classifier: hard failures never auto-revive.

The recovery mechanism (v1.5.4) gives a transient worker failure ONE
automatic revive after a backoff instead of leaving NR off until the
user presses Num1. The classifier decides which failures are transient:
0xBAD00001 (FeatureNotSupported - the GPU cannot run the pass at all,
Turing or a broken runtime build) is permanent - retrying only spins
the restart loop. Everything else (0x00000000 no-frame, timeouts,
driver hiccups, TDR code 6) can clear on its own and is worth a revive.

Checked: the classifier returns True only for 0xBAD00001, and the
auto-revive deadline is armed only for transient failures.
