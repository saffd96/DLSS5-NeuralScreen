"""Build the NeuralScreen v1.5.1 release archive: git files + artifacts + runtime.

The archive carries a VERSION.txt manifest (git commit, runtime SHA-256,
target architectures) so a user can tell exactly which build they have.
The build refuses to package a runtime whose kernels do not match the
expected set (the v1.5.0 mistake: a zip that claimed "everything" but
carried a Blackwell-only DLL).
