"""The theme the user picked survives a pipeline rebuild.

A rebuild - a monitor switch, a GPU switch, one-window mode - recreates the
menu and restores its theme from st.cfg. The theme was only written to
config.json when the menu closed, so a switch while the menu was open
restored the OLD value and threw the user back to light (issue #33, seen in
a user's log: "menu theme -> dark", then a monitor change, then light
again).

So the action lands in st.cfg immediately, and the file write stays where it
was. This test drives the menu action and then the restore that
rebuild_pipeline performs.

The restore is exercised through the PRODUCT's rebuild_pipeline, not a copy
of its three lines. An earlier version of this file re-implemented the
restore locally, so deleting pipeline.py's actual restore left the test
green (audit: DISHONEST-DOC). The stubs follow test_rebuild_warmup.py, which
already drives the real rebuild for the warm-up contract.
