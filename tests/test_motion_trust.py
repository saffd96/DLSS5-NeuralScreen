"""Motion vectors where nothing moved are dropped (A2).

The desktop is mostly still, and optical flow is worst exactly where the
picture matters most: on text, icons, window borders. When a window slides
across a page of text, DIS finds "motion" on the text as well - text beside
a moving edge looks explainable by a shift - and NGX, handed those vectors,
smears the text it should have left alone.

The noise floor that was already there is a test of LENGTH. It cannot see a
wrong vector that happens to be long, which is this whole class of error.

What guards it now is the static hypothesis: warp the previous frame by the
vector and keep the vector only if it explains the pixel better than
standing still does. Measured against the usual alternative - a second DIS
pass and a forward/backward consistency check - it is three times cheaper
and catches far more (the numbers are in guides.py, beside the constants).

This pins the behaviour on synthetic frames, so it needs no captures and no
GPU:

1. Video playing inside a window leaves the page around it alone.
2. What really moves still gets its vectors - the guard must not simply
   zero everything.
3. A verdict that changes does not change straight back. A guard
   re-decided from scratch every frame makes threshold cells alternate, and
   the motion field alternates with them - the guard becomes a source of
   the shimmer it exists to remove. Measured before the memory was added:
   8.10% of the live cells changed verdict between frames on a game scene
   and 49.2% of those flipped straight back.
4. The cost stays near the measured budget.

Negative control: with the static hypothesis disabled the same scene puts
false vectors on 5.2% of the still page instead of 0.3%, so the test is
measuring the guard and not the scene.
