"""HotkeyController - global hotkeys through RegisterHotKey + a polling fallback.

The difference from polling GetAsyncKeyState is fundamental: the system
delivers WM_HOTKEY only to us and does NOT pass the keypress to the active
application. Num1 inside a game toggles NR and the game never sees the key.
Polling cannot do that — it only peeks at the key state while the press still
reaches the game.

The flip side of the same property: while NeuralScreen runs, the numpad
digits it binds belong to it and other programs (games, a spreadsheet) will
not get them.

Quitting is on Ctrl+Alt deliberately: a single key for it is far too easy to
hit by accident. Bare arrows are never registered either - they would stop
working system-wide.

RegisterHotKey(NULL, ...) posts WM_HOTKEY to the message queue of the CALLING
thread, so no window is needed — only a message loop in our own thread.
Commands go into the same queue the tray uses: the command vocabulary is
shared ("quit", "settings", "toggle", "scale_up", "scale_down").
