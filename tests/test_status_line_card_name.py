"""The status line: the readings must be visible, and in the right order.

The bug: the readings were laid out from the RIGHT edge in reverse order and
any value that ran out of room was silently skipped, which made the FIRST
casualty NR - the rate people watch - while the resolution (printed again in
the source section above) stayed. Measured at 4K with a real card name: NR and
FG gone, "SKIP 0  3840x2160" on screen. A reading nobody can see reads as a
broken counter.

The line is now: dot, state, card name on the left; NR and FG anchored to the
right edge, FG at the very edge. The card name takes what room is left, so it
can never push a reading off the bar. Resolution, the skipped-frame count and
the frame counter are gone from the line by decision - all three are numbers
nobody acts on, and the resolution is already printed above.

What this test locks:
  * one line, and it fits inside its block (no leftover reserved strip);
  * NR and FG are on screen, in that order, with FG at the right edge - not
    merely rendered, but blitted where they can be seen;
  * the removed values really are gone, so nobody re-adds them by accident;
  * the card name is still drawn (it is the one value that cannot be guessed);
  * at a width where something must be dropped, NR survives.
