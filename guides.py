    #: the capture, the motion upscale and the presentation have all moved to
    #: the GPU.

    #: Why it is not the default. Scored against synthetic ground truth (a

    #: flow px for displacements from 1 to 16 px - comfortably inside the
    #: _flow_noise_floor this class already zeroes, so on average it cannot
    #: even reach the motion field. Its TAILS are the worry: p99 0.49 px at a
    #: 1 px shift, and a maximum of 31.6 px against fast's 8.5 px at a 32 px
    #: shift. Tails are what a temporal network shows as smearing, and
    #: nothing here can judge that without the GPU pipeline and real moving
    #: content in front of a person. So it ships as a switch with its numbers
