"""Every step of main's teardown runs, whatever the one before it does.

main's `finally` block releases the recording, the worker, the shared section,
the menu layout, the capture, the window, the hotkeys, the tray and the
taskbar. All of them were individually wrapped except two:

    if st.worker is not None:
        shutdown_worker(st.worker, st.worker_stop)
    if st.shm is not None:
        st.shm.close()

A raise from either propagates out of the `finally` and skips everything after
it in one go: capture and window stay open, the hotkey thread, the tray icon
and the 1x1 taskbar window stay alive, and the borderless topmost overlay is
still on screen with no loop left behind it - frozen there until the user kills
the process. shutdown_worker closes a pipe and prints, and on a pythonw process
stdout is the log file, so a log that has become unwritable (replaced, volume
gone, a sharing violation from the user's own log viewer) raises out of print.

Checked here by reading main.py. Running the real teardown would need a live
window, worker and tray; what has to hold is the invariant, and it is checkable
in the source: in the `finally` block, every statement that can raise is
guarded, and the order is kept.
