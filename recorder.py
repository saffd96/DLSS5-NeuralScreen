"""VideoRecorder - writes NR overlay frames into an MP4 (NVENC + AAC).

Records the frames Python receives from the worker (output_rgba) while
recording is on (Num0). Frames arrive full-res RGBA8 every ~30 ms; PyAV
converts them to yuv420p and encodes them through NVENC (AV1, or HEVC/H.264
on GPUs without an AV1 encoder - the first codec that opens wins).

System audio comes from WASAPI loopback (audio.LoopbackCapture) as a second
track. It is best-effort: a machine without a playback endpoint still records
video, it just gets no sound.

Recording does not depend on ShadowPlay/OBS: the overlay is excluded from
external capture (WDA_EXCLUDEFROMCAPTURE), so the video is written from the
inside - exactly the NR result that is on screen.
