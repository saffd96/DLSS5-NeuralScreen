"""TaskbarWindow - a taskbar button for the program.

The overlay is a borderless click-through window and the worker window is
a tool window, so neither shows in the taskbar - the program lived only
in the tray. A taskbar button is what users expect from a desktop app
(user rule 2026-09-09: "всегда отображалась в панели задач а не только
в трее").

The button is a real top-level window with WS_EX_APPWINDOW: a 1x1 visible
window parked at the corner of the screen. Clicking its taskbar button
activates it; the window procedure turns that into an idempotent menu-show
command. The tray/hotkey retain their useful toggle semantics, but duplicate
taskbar activation must never close a visible menu. The window itself never
shows anything.

The icon comes from native/neuralscreen.ico (the same one the launcher
uses), so the taskbar button looks like the program.
