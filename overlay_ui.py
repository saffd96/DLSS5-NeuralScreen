"""OverlayMenu - the settings menu right inside the overlay layer, like ReShade.

It is drawn on the same pygame surface as the HUD and the alerts, so there is
still a single window: no fight over topmost and focus with the game.

Separation of duties: this module BUILDS THE LAYOUT and DRAWS it. It does not
touch pygame.display, does not read events and knows nothing about the worker.
The layout is a flat list of items with rectangles, and the same list serves as
the hit table for the mouse (hit()).

The layout is line-based: every control has its own label line and its own line
for the control itself. They used to share one line and the label ran into the
value and the arrows.

All sizes are given in 1440p base units and multiplied by scale - the same
factor the HUD uses (display.ui_scale_for).
