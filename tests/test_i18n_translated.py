"""Interface text is translated, not just present (audit M3).

tests/test_i18n.py checks key parity and non-empty values. That is why 34
strings could sit in the tree as verbatim English in ten of the twelve
languages while the README and the release body advertised "12 languages": the
bulk `update()` pattern adds every key to every language with the English value
first, which guarantees non-emptiness and nothing else. The RECORDING and
CAPTURE tabs were English in French, German, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese,
Polish, Ukrainian, Chinese, Japanese and Korean; Russian was the only table
that had been translated.

This test states the rule the module docstring already warns about: a string
the user reads must be in the user's language. Two things keep it honest:

* a small, explicit list of strings that are NOT translated on purpose - brand
  names, product terms and endonyms (NR, FG, NVOFA, DLSS, Boost, "English",
  "30 fps"). Anything else that matches English in every language is a miss.
* the same check per language: a key translated in nine languages and English
  in the tenth is a miss for that one, which the all-languages rule would hide.
