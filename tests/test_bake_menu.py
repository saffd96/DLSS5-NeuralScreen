"""An open menu ends up in the recorded frame and in the screenshot.

Our window is marked WDA_EXCLUDEFROMCAPTURE, so it cannot appear in a capture
of the desktop - and therefore cannot appear in the frame we save, either.
Everything of ours that must be IN the file is drawn onto the frame by
`display.draw_capture_overlay`, on top of the pixels the capture already
returned. That is what puts the settings panel into a screenshot (and into a
recording) while the HUD and the watermark stay out.

Checked, off-screen with the dummy video driver:

* a CLOSED menu leaves the frame byte-for-byte alone - the old failure mode
  was a panel that lingered in every shot;
* an OPEN menu covers its own panel rect, and nothing outside that rect is
  touched (a bake that bled outside would paint over the picture);
* the "grabbed an edge" hover highlight does not reach the file (it is cursor
  state, and it used to freeze into the frame).

This was `test_bake_menu.py` in the project root, run by nobody - the suite
registry never listed it, so the screenshot behaviour it guards had no
regression check at all (audit: DEAD, same class as test_spout_library).

Run:  runtime\\python.exe tests\\test_bake_menu.py
