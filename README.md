# NeuralScreen

**NVIDIA's DLSS 5 neural renderer, applied to your whole Windows desktop in
real time.** Everything on screen — games, video, photos — goes through the
same neural network that DLSS 5 games use, and comes back sharper.

*One menu inside the overlay, in a light and a dark theme; the settings page;
the window list. The **Before / after wipe** slider splits the screen down the
middle so you can see what the effect is actually doing.*

## What you need

- **Windows 11**, or Windows 10 — reported working.
- **An NVIDIA RTX card:**

  | Cards | Status |
  |---|---|
  | **RTX 50** / **RTX 40** / **RTX 30** | ✅ works |
  | **RTX 20** (Turing) | ❌ below the minimum architecture — the program starts, the picture is not processed |
  | **Hybrid laptops (Optimus)** | ✅ works; on the iGPU display the capture falls back to a slower path |

- **The latest NVIDIA driver, and Windows up to date.** Not a formality: the
  neural runtime talks to the driver directly, and an old driver is the
  commonest reason it refuses to start or the picture never appears.
- **Nothing installed.** The release archive brings its own Python.

## Install

1. Download the archive from [Releases](https://github.com/perseval-BLR/DLSS5-NeuralScreen/releases)
   and unpack it anywhere. Everything is inside, including NVIDIA's runtime.
2. Run **`NeuralScreen.exe`**.

Windows will probably warn you about an unknown publisher — the program is not
signed with a paid certificate. Click *More info* → *Run anyway*, or use
`NeuralScreen.vbs` next to it.

There is no installer: to remove the program, delete the folder. Autostart is
the one thing written outside it — turn it off before you move or delete it.

> **Do not use it in competitive online games.** A fullscreen overlay over a
> game is what anti-cheat systems look for.

## Using it

The program sits in the tray and draws over your desktop. Press **Num2** for
the menu. The hotkeys are on the numpad, so **Num Lock has to be on**.

| Key | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Num2** | open / close the menu |
| **Num1** | neural rendering on / off |
| **Num3** | screenshot |
| **Num0** | start / stop recording, with sound |
| **Num4** / **Num6** | processing resolution down / up |
| **Num5** | capture the window under the cursor |
| **Ctrl+Alt+Q** | quit |

Every key can be reassigned in the menu, under the sliders icon. While the
menu is open it takes the mouse and keyboard, so it works on top of a game;
closed, clicks go straight through it.

### Whole screen or one window

The whole screen is the default. **Source**, second in the menu, switches
between **Fullscreen** and **Window mode**; choosing the second opens the list
of windows, and hovering a row highlights that window on the screen. **Num5**
is the shortcut when the window is already in front of you: point at it and
press. The overlay follows the window as it moves, and resizing it — a video
going fullscreen, a different player size — reconfigures the worker in place,
with no black moment. Minimising the window pauses processing.

## The menu

The dot next to your graphics card is green when neural rendering is really
running on it, red when it is not.

- **Source** — the whole screen or one window, and which window.
- **Profile** — how strong the effect is, from *Faithful* to *Extreme*;
  *Natural* by default. The four sliders underneath are the same thing in
  detail. **Save preset** stores the current values under a name and puts it
  in the Profile list; **Delete preset** removes it. Dark scenes are
  brightened automatically so shadows keep their detail.
- **Model** — *which* network produces the picture, as opposed to how
  strongly. Three of them, and they are three different outputs rather than
  three strengths: **Default** is the one that suits a desktop, **Natural**
  and **Cinematic** are tuned for games and soften photographs and small
  text.
  Measured on a desktop capture, fine detail against the untouched frame:
  Default **+18.7%**, Natural **−11.4%**, Cinematic **−23.4%**. Picking a
  profile sets a style; this overrides it.
- **Before / after wipe** — leaves the left part of the screen unprocessed so
  you can see what the effect is doing. Back to 0 when done.
- **Boost** — on by default. The network runs at a reduced resolution and a
  slider under the switch chooses which: measured on a 5070 Ti at 4K,
  **45.7 → 72.6 frames** at the default step and **83.4** at the lowest.
  The picture stays sharp — the network's result is composed onto your
  original frame, so text and edges keep full resolution. Turn it off to
  compare.

Everything else is behind the sliders icon: which monitor is processed and
which card does it, HDR compatibility, the screenshot folder, Spout2 output,
the recording indicator, leaving an unchanged screen alone, opening the menu
on launch, autostart, the key assignments, the theme — and the language, of
which there are **12**: English, Russian, French, German, Spanish, Italian,
Portuguese, Polish, Ukrainian, Chinese, Japanese and Korean.

## Recording and screenshots

**Num0** records what you see, with system sound, into an MP4 in
`recordings`. **Num3** saves a screenshot. The menu appears in both if it is
open, on purpose. A red dot with a timer sits in the corner while recording
(it can be turned off in the settings).

Screenshots open a **Save As** dialog; set **Screenshot folder...** in the
settings once and it will start there every time.

**Recording externally:**

- **OBS (recommended):** turn on **Spout2 output (OBS)** in the settings, then
  add a **Spout2 Capture** source in OBS. Works in any mode. Off by default.
- **NVIDIA App:** it has no Spout input, so use one-window mode — pick the
  window, record, then switch back to **Fullscreen**. In that mode the overlay
  is visible to screen capture; in full-screen mode it hides itself.

## If something is not working

**Nothing appears after launch.** Check `NeuralScreen.log` next to the
program — it names the cause. The commonest is a missing
`native\nvngx_dlssnr.dll`.

**The overlay is invisible in a game.** True fullscreen cannot have anything
drawn over it — a Windows rule. Switch the game to *borderless*.

**The menu pointer is missing or frozen.** A fullscreen game hides the system
cursor, and the overlay only shows that one. Borderless fixes it.

**The picture is soft.** Turn *Boost* off, or move its slider up a step.

**Everything is too bright and the sliders do nothing.** HDR is on for that
display. Turn it off (Win+Alt+B), or try **HDR compatibility** in the settings,
under CAPTURE — it is experimental; see [HDR setup](https://github.com/perseval-BLR/DLSS5-NeuralScreen/blob/main/docs/HDR.md).

**A key does nothing.** Something else claimed it; reassign it in the menu.

## Known limitations

- **True fullscreen games** cannot have an overlay drawn over them — borderless or windowed only.
- **HDR displays:** experimental, and off until you turn on **HDR compatibility** (settings, CAPTURE). Recording and Spout exports stay SDR. See [HDR setup and limitations](https://github.com/perseval-BLR/DLSS5-NeuralScreen/blob/main/docs/HDR.md).
- **Windows 10 and two NVIDIA cards are experimental** — built or fixed from user logs rather than tested here. Reports welcome.
- **A rotated display:** 180° is turned back over on capture; 90° and 270° are not handled yet and come out with the sides swapped.
- **Pipeline latency** is 40–60 ms (17-20ms with Boost Mode) — fine interactively, not competitively; **processing resolution is capped at 2560×1440**, output is always your full native resolution.
