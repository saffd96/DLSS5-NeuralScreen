"""A refused multiplier steps down; it must not kill Frame Generation (issue #100).

A card whose DLSS-G runtime stops at 2x answered a request for 3x/4x with a
refusal. The worker treated that refusal as "Frame Generation does not work on
this GPU": it set g_fg.failed, released everything, and every later frame went
through the ordinary present path. The switch on the panel stayed on (or, with
the #76 verdict, flipped itself off with an alert) while the card could have
run 2x perfectly well - the multiplier is a preference, not a capability.

Checked here:

* the ceiling is read from what the runtime itself reports
  (DLSSG.MultiFrameCountMax), so a 2x card is never asked for 4x in the first
  place;
* a refused create OR evaluation steps the multiplier down instead of failing
  the feature, and 2x is the floor - a refusal there is a real refusal;
* the request is clamped to the ceiling, so the step that already failed is
  not asked for again on every frame;
* switching FG off and on gives the user's choice a fresh attempt;
* the retry frame is not reported as a dead feature;
* the worker compiles with all of it.
