"""Command recording must not grow with rebuilds (plan 18.09, item 3).

The open question was whether repeated RNSZ rebuilds (every slider step sends
one) leak command allocators and lists. They do not, and this pins the reasons
so the property cannot be lost silently.

What the code does, and why that is enough:

* the worker's own allocators are a fixed ring - `Host::kFrames` (3) created
  once, each reused only after its own `alloc_fence` has passed
  (`BeginCommands` resets the slot's allocator and list, and the retire wait
  comes first). Nothing is created per frame;
* the extra allocator/list/fence pairs (`InitDisguise`, the pump pair) are
  created once per process, at startup - a fixed cost, not a leak;
* the FG presenter's allocator/list/fence are `winrt::com_ptr`, so they are
  released when `FgPresenter` returns, and `EnsureFg` calls `CloseFgResources()`
  before it creates a new presenter. A rebuild closes before it opens;
* RNSZ releases the TEXTURES (`ReleaseVideoTextures` nulls every one) and
  leaves the allocators alone - correct, because they are not per-size.

Checked here:

1. the per-frame path (`BeginCommands`) resets an existing allocator instead of
   creating one, and waits for the slot fence before the reset;
2. no `CreateCommandAllocator`/`CreateCommandList` call sits in a per-frame
   function - the count of creation sites is small and each is once-per-process
   or behind a close;
3. `EnsureFg` closes FG resources before creating a presenter;
4. `ReleaseVideoTextures` releases every texture it owns (a missing one is the
   actual leak class that was found here before - issue #48).

Provable by mutation: move a creation call into `BeginCommands`, or drop a
`Release` from `ReleaseVideoTextures`, and the matching check goes red.
