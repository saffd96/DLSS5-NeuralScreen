"""The two composites are a live switch, and they really are two (A7).

With Boost on, the network runs at the work resolution and its result has to
get back to full size. There are two ways, and the program has only ever
shipped one:

  * **matched residual** - compose native + (nr_out_up - nr_in_up) * strength.
    The native frame stays the 1:1 anchor, so text and edges keep their full
    resolution and the network only contributes what it changed.
  * **direct reconstruction** - show what the network produced, stretched.
    A stronger, more obviously "processed" picture, and a softer one.

Which is better is a question about pictures, not about code, so the switch
had to be cheap enough to flip while looking at something: it travels in the
resize flags (RESIZE_FLAG_NR_DIRECT) and costs no NGX feature, exactly like
the four sliders since C1.

**It has now been measured, and residual wins on all three content types.**
Boost 832x468 -> 1280x720, profile Natural, 1:1 crops of a browser page, a
video frame and a game scene. Ratios are against the native input:

    source  composite   deviation   edges  detail
    text    residual         1.30   1.070   0.959
    text    direct           2.21   0.782   0.211
    film    residual        22.45   1.020   0.884
    film    direct          23.01   0.872   0.180
    game    residual         8.98   1.158   1.051
    game    direct           9.40   0.973   0.361

"detail" is the variance of the Laplacian - grain, texture, small type.
Direct reconstruction keeps a fifth to a third of it. It is not a stronger
picture in exchange, either: the deviation from native is the same within a
few tenths, so the extra is softness, not effect. On the game scene residual
even comes out above the native frame on both measures (1.158 / 1.051),
which is what the composite is for.

So: no menu control, and this stays a debug switch. The test keeps the
switch working so the question can be reopened cheaply - at a lower Boost
step, say, where the network's own output carries relatively more.

What this pins:

1. Flipping the composite does **not** rebuild the feature. One
   "video memory after feature create" for the whole run - the same
   evidence test_feature_leak reads.
2. The worker says which composite is live, so an A/B session can be read
   back out of a log afterwards.
3. The two composites really do produce different pixels. A switch that
   quietly does nothing would pass 1 and 2 and be worthless.
4. Flipping back returns the old picture - the switch is a switch, not a
   one-way door.
