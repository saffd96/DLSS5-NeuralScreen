"""Display module for the DLSS 5 Desktop NR prototype.

Borderless fullscreen window for the frame + the in-overlay settings
menu. The window is hidden at creation and revealed on the first real
frame (no blank flash at launch); it is excluded from screen capture
via SetWindowDisplayAffinity(WDA_EXCLUDEFROMCAPTURE) so that
screen-capture tools (dxcam, OBS) do not see it. Mode switches (Num5,
monitor change) are covered by a semi-transparent blur + spinner
overlay (enter_switch_mode / exit_switch_mode).

Usage:
    disp = Display(2560, 1440)
    disp.set_hud({"fps": 60, "status": "NR ON", "resolution": "2560x1440",
                  "params": {"intensity": 0.5, "local_tone": 0.3,
                             "local_structure": 0.7}, "frames": 1234})
    while True:
        disp.show(frame_bgra)
        for ev in disp.poll_events():
            if ev == "quit":
                break
