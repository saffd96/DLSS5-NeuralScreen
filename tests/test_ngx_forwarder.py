"""The NGX caller rule, both ways it can be satisfied.

nvngx_dlssnr.dll decides whether to answer by looking at the module the call
RETURNS to - not at the process name. If that module's path does not carry the
substring "nvngx.dll", it refuses with FAIL_PlatformError (0xBAD00002) before
it even reads the arguments.

R8 settled what that means for the worker: the worker IS an executable named
nvngx.dll (native\nvngx.dll), so its own path carries the substring and the
calls leave the worker itself - the forwarding layer is the escape hatch
(NS_FORWARDER=1), not the default. Measured live: ~2400 frames through the
direct path, zero restarts.

Three legs, all against the real library:

* the worker as shipped: the log says the calls leave the worker itself, and
  Init_Ext returns Success;
* NS_FORWARDER=1: the log names the forwarder it loaded (path carries the
  substring), and Init_Ext returns Success through it;
* the same forwarder binary copied to a name WITHOUT the substring
  (NS_FORWARDER points at the copy): the call is refused with 0xBAD00002.

The third leg is the one that matters. Without it this test would pass just as
happily if the library had stopped checking anything at all.
