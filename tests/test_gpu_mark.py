"""A card that refused the neural pass is marked in the picker, not hidden.

DXGI reports some cards twice. One user has a single RTX 5080 listed as
adapters 0 and 2, and only one of the two can bring the neural pass up - the
other kills the worker. From outside the two entries are the same string, so
the menu was offering a choice between two identical lines, one of which
breaks the program (issue #33).

Merging them by name is not available: on a machine with two identical cards
that would remove a real choice. What IS known is what was tried, so that is
what the picker says - and it says it as a note, not a lock:

* an adapter whose switch was rolled back is remembered and marked;
* it stays selectable, and the mark is dropped the moment it does work
  (a driver update is the usual reason);
* the mark survives a restart, because it goes into the config;
* the index in the label is untouched, because that is what the action is
  parsed from.

The label expression itself is EXECUTED here, taken from `menu_payload`'s own
line in settings_io.py. The previous version rebuilt the string with its own
copy of the expression, so deleting `_no_nr(st)` from the product - or changing
its wording - still passed: it was testing its own concatenation.
