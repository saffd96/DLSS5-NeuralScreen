"""One window's size, measured two ways, must not start a rebuild loop.

In window mode two numbers describe the same window and they are not the
same number on every Windows:

  * what the WORKER's capture returns (the WGCW ack) - this becomes
    st.width/height, the size the pipeline is built for;
  * what WE measure with DWMWA_EXTENDED_FRAME_BOUNDS - this is what
    follow_window looks at every frame to notice a resize.

On Windows 11 they agree. On Windows 10 WGC hands back the GetWindowRect
size, which includes the invisible resize border: a user's log (issue #30)
shows capture 1354x853 against frame 1340x846 - 14 pixels of border across
and 7 down. follow_window compared the two directly, never found them equal,
and rebuilt the pipeline every half second: the screen blinked once every
two seconds until window mode was switched off.

So the comparison is against the frame size measured when the pipeline was
built. This test drives follow_window with the numbers from that log.
