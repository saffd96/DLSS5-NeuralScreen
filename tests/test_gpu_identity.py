"""The status line names the card that really runs (issue #81).

NVAPI and DXGI enumerate adapters in their own orders, and on a machine
with two cards the orders disagree. Issue #81: a 4070 Super + 3050 box
ran the pipeline on the 4070 (NS_GPU=0 names DXGI's first NVIDIA card -
Task Manager showed the 4070 doing the work), while the panel and the
About block said "RTX 3050 · Ampere" - the first card NVAPI enumerated.
The displayed card was picked by position, not by the card the worker
runs on.

The fix: every caller of gpuinfo.probe passes the DXGI NAME of the
adapter the worker will really land on (startup._working_card_name, the
same fallback rule the worker applies: an unusable NS_GPU falls back to
the first NVIDIA adapter), and probe describes the card with that name.

Checked:
1. _choose_index matches the hint case-insensitively and falls back to
   the first card for a missing/None/unknown hint.
2. _working_card_name mirrors the worker fallback: exact index, first
   card for an index this machine does not have, first card for junk.
3. _log_environment passes the hint into gpuinfo.probe (monkeypatched).
4. The bring_up call site passes it too (source check - running it needs
   a full hardware bring-up).
5. Real nvapi on this machine: probing by this machine's own adapter
   name answers identically to the no-hint probe (single-card case).
