"""The save dialog must open where the user's folder is, or say why not (M2).

The folder picker returns a Path and drain_save_dialog stores it as a string in
st.cfg, which save_menu_layout writes back into config.json. _validate_config
accepts a str and coerces anything else to "", so the value survives as long as
it is a string.

The half that is directly readable in the source is the dialog's start point:
it was `str(shot_dir) if ... else None`, with no existence check. A folder that
has since been deleted, or that lives on a drive which is not connected right
now, was handed to the dialog anyway - and the library then falls back to its
own default location without telling anybody, so the user's chosen folder looks
like it was forgotten.

Checked here: a folder that exists is used as the start point; one that does
not exist (or is a file, or an empty string) is not, and the fallback is what
the dialog gets.

The other half of M2 - st.cfg and config.json diverging so that a save writes
"" - is UNCONFIRMED in the audit itself and needs two writers (or a hand edit
between a folder pick and the next save) to reproduce; nothing here claims it.
