"""The z-order guard must see windows on EVERY monitor (issue #89).

Report (raycornea): with the panel open, toggling NR left the panel invisible
on the second display - but it WAS in the screenshot. The screenshot bakes the
panel from its own coordinates, so the panel really was drawn; what failed was
the pair being re-asserted above the picture, which is what the 30-frame
z-order guard does.

The guard skips helper windows by testing each rect against the desktop - and
it tested the PRIMARY screen (SM_CXSCREEN), not the virtual desktop. On a
monitor to the LEFT of the primary every window has a negative x: a
full-screen window there is (-2560, 0, 0, 1440) and the old test
`rect.right > 0 and rect.left < screen_w` rejected it. So on a left-hand
second display the guard never found a real window, never re-asserted the HUD,
and the panel stayed under the picture.

Checked here:

* a full-screen window on a monitor LEFT of the primary counts (the reported
  case) - this is what the old rule failed;
* the same on a monitor RIGHT of the primary, above and below it;
* helper windows are still skipped: the 1x1 dwm thumbnail, the 0x0 IME
  entries, the off-screen Narrator helper at -40000,-40000;
* the virtual desktop really is queried by the Display method, not the
  primary screen.
