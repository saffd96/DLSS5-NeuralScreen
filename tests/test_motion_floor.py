"""A slow scroll survives the noise filter, on content with structure.

The upstream test drove DIS with a mock over FLAT frames and expected a
uniform one-pixel scroll to survive everywhere. Two of its premises do
not hold in this codebase, both deliberately:

- MV validation (A2) drops a vector where it explains the pixel no better
  than standing still - flat content is exactly that case, and
  test_motion_trust pins the behaviour;
- the flow grid is 320x180 at every source size, so one REAL pixel is
  0.125 flow pixels at 4K, below the 0.5-pixel noise floor by design.

So this variant scrolls a pattern with real structure by two flow pixels
(above the floor at every size) and asserts what the guards guarantee:
the moving region keeps its vector scaled to real pixels, the subpixel
noise stays at zero, and a genuinely static frame reports none.
