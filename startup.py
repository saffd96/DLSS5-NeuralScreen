"""Getting the program ready: from a config file to a running pipeline.

A straight line that runs once, kept away from the loop that runs sixty times
a second. Two halves, in the order they happen:

  configure()  decides what the program is going to do - the config and the
               NR parameters, which monitor, and at what resolution. The
               resolution comes from the REAL monitor rather than from the
               config: a display switched to 1440p while config.json still
               says 4K would leave the overlay, the recording and the worker
               window drifting away from the screen.
  bring_up()   makes it exist - the shared memory, the worker, the overlay,
               the tray icon, the taskbar button, the hotkeys, the guides,
               and every default on the state object the loop then reads.

Order is the whole content of this module. The worker is started before the
overlay because it is the slow part; the menu captions are set only after the
hotkeys are registered, because before that there are no bindings to name;
and the state defaults come last, so nothing the loop reads is missing when
the first frame arrives.
