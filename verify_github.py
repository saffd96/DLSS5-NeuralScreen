"""Verify what actually landed on GitHub after a push / release.

The release is not done when the local tree is committed: the READMEs,
the screenshots and the release assets must be verified against what
GitHub actually serves. This script checks, for the current version:

1. docs/screenshot-*.png - local sha256 == raw.githubusercontent.com/main
2. README.md / README.ru.md / TECHNICAL.md / TECHNICAL.ru.md - same
3. the release tag: assets (zip + 4 docs), zip digest == local, Latest
4. the repository description carries the current feature markers

Usage:  runtime\\python.exe verify_github.py [tag]
        (tag defaults to the version in build_release_zip.py)

Exit code 0 = everything on GitHub matches the local tree.
