"""The chosen monitor moves BOTH output windows, with the real worker running.

test_monitor_origin checks the hand-offs one at a time and moves the pygame
layer on its own. This one runs the whole program and looks at where the
windows actually are - the overlay AND the worker's picture window - because
that pair is what a user on a second monitor sees, or does not (issues #28,
#33, #35: the program ran, logged frames, answered hotkeys, and painted on
the primary display).

There is one display on the machine this is developed on, which is why the
bug shipped twice. So the program is started with capture.monitor_origin
lying about where that display is: the code takes the same branch it takes
on a second monitor, only the number differs. Both windows must land on it.

The test process makes itself per-monitor DPI aware before measuring -
without that Windows reports scaled coordinates and a window at (220, 160)
comes back as (176, 128) on a 125% display.
