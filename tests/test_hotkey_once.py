"""One press of a hotkey must produce exactly one command.

There are two paths to the same command: RegisterHotKey (WM_HOTKEY) and the
polling fallback that exists for games which grab the keyboard. Both ran for
every press, and nothing told the poller that a WM_HOTKEY had already been
delivered - so on the desktop every hotkey fired TWICE. A toggle looked stuck
("Num1 only ever switches NR on"), the menu opened and closed on one press,
and inside a game it all worked, because a game that swallows WM_HOTKEY leaves
the poller as the only path.

The second half of the same bug: a key held down re-fired the command every
cooldown. A press is an edge, not a state.

Third case, found while this test kept failing in the suite: the baseline that
stops a stuck key from firing was taken on the POLLER'S FIRST SAMPLE, so in a
game - where WM_HOTKEY never arrives and the poller is the only path - the
first press after launch was recorded as "already down" and swallowed. The
baseline is taken at registration now, which is before the poller's first tick.

F13 is the test key: nothing else on the machine uses it, and no physical
keyboard sends it by accident.

    This is the case the polling fallback exists for: a game holds the

    The baseline that stops a stuck key from firing used to be taken on the
    poller's FIRST SAMPLE (`was_down = self._poll_down.get(vk, down)`), so a
    press whose whole lifetime fell before that sample was recorded as
    "already down" and swallowed - the very first hotkey press after launch
    did nothing. Measured before the fix: 6 of 6 presses lost this way.

    The baseline now comes from _register(), which runs before the poller's

    The game is stood in for by making the registration FAIL - which is what
    a swallowed keyboard means for us - rather than by replacing _register.
