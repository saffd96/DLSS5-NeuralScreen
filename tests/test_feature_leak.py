"""Rebuilding the NGX feature must not leak video memory (issue #48).

"When I slide intensity or other sliders, the VRAM creeps up. If I just
slide it back and forth, it will fill all the way up until the program (and
anything using VRAM) crashes."

Every slider step calls request_apply, which sends RNSZ, and the worker
answers it by releasing the feature and creating a new one. The release went
to the NGX **core** while the feature had been created by
nvngx_dlssnr.dll - a different implementation, which knows nothing about
that handle - so nothing was freed. Measured before the fix: **+12.6 GB over
30 rebuilds**, about 420 MB each, filling a 16 GB card in half a minute.

The worker reports its own usage through QueryVideoMemoryInfo after every
feature create, so this needs no external tool and a user's log shows the
same number.

Two shapes, because a slider and the resolution slider take different paths
through the same code: the same work size (only parameters changed) and
alternating sizes.

Since C1 the first of those does not rebuild at all - a same-size RNSZ
takes the parameters and acks, the feature untouched - so there is no
release/create pair left to get wrong. That half of the test now checks
that the rebuild really is gone; the resolution slider still rebuilds and
is still measured for growth.
