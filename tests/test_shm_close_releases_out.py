"""Closing the frame buffer releases every section it opened (audit H3).

SharedFrameBuffer owns three named sections: the input (colour+motion), the
reverse gray channel, and the reverse pixel channel (OUTS). close() released
the input and delegated gray to close_gray(), but never touched the pixel
channel - close_out() existed and did the right thing, yet outside open_out()
it had no caller in the program.

The OUTS channel is on by default, and enable_out_shm calls open_out() once per
pipeline build. Every rebuild - monitor switch, window switch, Spout, HDR,
motion backend, GPU switch - runs teardown_pipeline, which closes the buffer,
and then replaces it with a new SharedFrameBuffer. The old object went away
with the only reference to a live 33,177,608-byte section and its mapping, so
one section stayed resident for the life of the process per rebuild: eight
switches retained ~264 MB that nothing could read or release. The same close()
at exit leaked one more.

Checked here with the real SharedFrameBuffer and no worker:

* close() releases all three sections when all three were open;
* it releases them when only some were opened (open_out without open_gray,
  and the reverse);
* the public surface afterwards is honest: reads report "not open" rather than
  returning pixels from a section that was supposedly released;
* close() is idempotent, and closable with nothing open.
