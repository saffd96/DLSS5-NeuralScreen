"""Every log line must carry a time, and a menu close must be logged.

Both come from reading four real diagnostic packages (issue reports of 19.09):
half of each log had no timestamp at all - of 916 lines (raycornea) 499 were
untimed, of 966 (saymoin) 477, of 243 (codemned) 145, of 220 (saymoin) 111, of
153 (manik) 76 - and the untimed half is exactly the half a report needs. "The
menu opened 21 times" cannot be placed against "the user minimised a window"
when neither line carries a time, and a z-order decision could only be dated by
its neighbouring line. The [z] lines and the menu lines were both in it.

The other half of that gap: only the settings/show_settings paths printed
"overlay menu opened/closed". The close button (and Esc, which arrives as the
same command) set menu.visible = False silently, so a package read "21 opened
against 0 closed" - uninterpretable, because a menu that was never closed and a
close that was never logged look identical.

Checked here:

1. the log stream stamps every untimed line, and does NOT stamp a line that
   already has a time (the worker writes its own, and a second prefix would
   break every parser that reads "16:03:11.482  [fg] ...");
2. the stamp survives a line written without a trailing newline, and a message
   containing several lines is stamped per line, not once;
3. the close-button path prints a close line, and records when the menu opened
   so the line can carry a duration;
4. `re` and `time` are imported for the wrapper (a missing one would make
   _init_logging fall into its bare `except` and silently disable the stamps).

Provable by mutation: drop the "already stamped" guard and worker lines get a
double prefix; remove the close print and check 3 fails; remove the import and
the module does not load.
