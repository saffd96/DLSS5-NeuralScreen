"""The feature-18 verdict dies with the worker that gave it.

st.gpu_ok is latched: refresh_gpu_ok() decides once and returns immediately
ever after, which is what keeps it off the per-frame path. The latch belongs
to ONE worker process though - a replacement calls CreateFeature again and
can answer differently.

Only rebuild_pipeline used to clear it, so the monitor and window switches
were right and the four restart paths were not: a card that started working
kept the red dot, and a pipeline that came back BROKEN kept the green one -
while TECHNICAL.md tells the user that dot is the thing to trust.

A live RNSZ resize is the exception that has to stay an exception:
resize_window_live keeps the same process, so the verdict it gave still
stands and must NOT be forgotten (that would put the dot back to "unknown"
for no reason, every time a captured window is resized).

Checked:
* forget_verdict clears both the verdict and the alert latch;
* every restart_worker() call site forgets the verdict right after;
* resize_window_live does not;
* the guides' bypass contract: clearing previous_gray makes the next real
  frame a scene cut rather than a correlation against a stale screen.
