"""Threaded encoding: write() does not block and the file comes out whole.

Checks the three things the change was made for:
  * write() returns quickly - otherwise the thread is pointless;
  * frames are not lost at a normal pace and do end up in the file;
  * close() waits for the encoder and the file reads back.

Plus an honesty check: frames are handed to the thread WITHOUT a copy, so we
verify the written picture matches the one handed over, not the last in queue.
