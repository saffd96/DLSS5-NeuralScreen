"""Run everything: the static checks, the regression tests, the smoke test.

There is one reason this file exists. The tests were run by hand, one at a
time, and that is how a regression shipped: audit #3 broke the shared-memory
pixel channel, `test_out_shm.py` caught it, and nobody ran `test_out_shm.py`.
One command, one verdict, a non-zero exit on any failure.

    runtime\\python.exe run_tests.py            static + tests + smoke
    runtime\\python.exe run_tests.py --gui      ... and the full GUI cycle
    runtime\\python.exe run_tests.py --only out_shm      one test by name
    runtime\\python.exe run_tests.py --no-smoke          skip the smoke test

Two of the stages take over the screen for a few seconds each (the overlay is
raised for real) and the machine should be left alone while they run. Nothing
here needs the network except the release-notes check inside autocheck.

Only tests tracked by git are run: the working copy also holds throwaway
probes, and those are nobody's regression suite.
