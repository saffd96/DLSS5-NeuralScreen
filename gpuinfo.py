"""GPU model and architecture, through nvapi, with no external processes.

The interface needs it: to show what we are running on and whether Neural
Rendering is available. The architecture is read the same way NVIDIA's own
library reads it (nvapi_QueryInterface -> NvAPI_GPU_GetArchInfo), so the
value matches the one it makes its decision on.

Everything is wrapped in try: without nvapi (a non-NVIDIA machine, a
stripped driver) the module returns empty fields instead of taking the
program down.
