"""A 10-bit display must not flip the capture format every frame (audit B1).

Measured in a real v1.13.1 log (issue #89, a 10-bit / HDR-capable display with
HDR compatibility off): 1955 `capture format 10 -> 87 - rebuilding the bridge`
lines in 133 seconds, i.e. ~15 teardown-and-rebuild cycles per second, plus
1969 allocations of a 3840x2160 cross-device shared texture. The log's own
`[perf] grab 43.0ms` and `NR 18.3 fps` are what that costs the user.

The mechanism, read out of the worker:

* with HDR compatibility off the capture is opened with the legacy
  `output1->DuplicateOutput(...)`, deliberately, because an earlier fix found
  `DuplicateOutput1` insufficient (#86);
* on a 10-bit output that legacy call does NOT pin the format - the very same
  log shows `[dda] SDR capture fixed to BGRA8 through legacy duplication`
  followed by the flips;
* `StageCapturedFrame` then sees a format that differs from its shared texture
  and tears the entire capture bridge down, once per flip.

The same log shows the fix: after the user turns HDR compatibility ON the code
takes the IDXGIOutput5 path, and the storm stops completely - 0 rebuilds for
the rest of the session. So the duplication CAN be pinned; it just was not
asked to be when the display is 10-bit and HDR compatibility is off.

The worker now reads the display's bit depth (IDXGIOutput6, already queried for
the log line) and, when it is deeper than 8 bits with HDR compatibility off,
asks for FP16 first through DuplicateOutput1 - the capture shader already
converts FP16 to SDR, so the picture is unchanged. BGRA8 stays as the second
accepted format for a driver that refuses FP16, and an 8-bit display keeps the
exact path it had.

Checked here, without a 10-bit display:

* the worker still compiles, with the fix in it;
* the decision reads the bit depth and not a constant, and the 10-bit branch
  exists and is gated on it;
* the legacy path is still there for an 8-bit output and for a refused FP16
  open, so nothing is lost on the hardware that works today;
* the HDR-compatibility path is untouched (the log proves it was already
  stable);
* the storm's cost is not re-introduced: the format-change branch still
  returns FormatChanged, i.e. it does not silently keep frames of the wrong
  format.
