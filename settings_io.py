Two directions of one subject. Out: the payload the overlay menu renders -

whether neural rendering is really running on it. In: the two things a user
changes through the menu that have to survive a restart - the menu's own
position and size, and the hotkey assignments.

Both go into config.json through the atomic writer rather than over the live

# --- DLSS 5 NR profiles (field order as in the converter) -----------------
#
# local_tone is half a point lower in every profile than it was through
# 1.8.1 (user, 13.09). The local tone mapping is the part that lifts
# shadows and flattens contrast, and at the old values it was doing more of
# that than the picture wanted - most visibly on dark scenes, where the
# brightening this program does anyway meets it head on. The four sliders
# still reach everything they reached: this moves where the profiles sit,
# not what the range allows.
#
# The profiles no longer carry `profile`, `preset` or `ui_correction`.
# Measured on the 310.8.0 runtime: every value of all three produces a
# byte-identical frame (colour-sweep-20260913, and tests/test_param_effect.py
# reports them every run). They are still sent - the wire layout is shared
# with the resize command and with a hundred tests - but they are sent as a
# fixed zero by the two packers, and nobody has to wonder about them again.
#
# Intensity is clamped at 1.00 inside NVIDIA's DLL, so the 1.65 and 2.50 the
# strong profiles used to ask for were the same picture as 1.00 all along.
# Extreme's local_structure comes down from 2.00 to the new 1.50 ceiling,
# which is the one real change here: measured, that is a detail metric of
# -14.4% against -13.5%, about a percent of the picture.
#
# The auto mask is on in every profile. Measured here on three real frames,
# a frozen input so anything moving between consecutive outputs is the
# network trembling rather than the picture changing:
#
#   source  mask   wiggle  shadows  peak   edges  detail  ms/frame
#   text       0    0.209    0.167    10   1.110   0.965      5.26
#   text       1    0.158    0.131    10   1.096   0.932      5.15
#   film       0    0.363    0.207     9   0.971   0.666      5.26
#   film       1    0.314    0.176     7   0.959   0.669      5.30
#   game       0    0.335    0.304     8   1.225   1.176      5.28
#   game       1    0.308    0.286     6   1.213   1.157      5.26
#
# It damps the trembling by 8-24% and the shadows by 6-22%, takes the peaks
# down (9->7, 8->6), and costs nothing in time - the per-frame figures are
# the same within noise. It is not free: on text it costs 3.4% of the fine
# detail. Text is also where it damps the most, and shimmering text is what
# people report, so that is the trade taken.
#
# The other reason is arithmetic: skin_structure is inert without it. With
# the mask off in two of the four profiles, the fourth slider in the menu
# did nothing at all in those two.
