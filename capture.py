"""ScreenCapture - desktop capture for the DLSS 5 NR prototype (desktop-nr).

Backend: DXCamera (Windows Desktop Duplication API, DXGI).
Frames come back as np.ndarray shape (H, W, 4) dtype uint8 in RGBA (dxcam
does the BGRA conversion itself, into a reusable buffer).

Monitor identity: monitors are matched by their DXGI DeviceName
('\\\\.\\DISPLAY1'), not by a positional index. list_monitors() pairs each
EnumDisplayMonitors entry with the dxcam output whose devicename matches, so
the returned index is the dxcam output_idx for THAT monitor. A saved
devicename therefore keeps pointing at the same physical monitor when the
arrangement changes (cable unplug, display reorder, laptop dock).

Example:
    cap = ScreenCapture(monitor_idx=0)
    frame = cap.grab()          # (2160, 3840, 4) uint8 RGBA
    cap.close()
