"""Re-registering hotkeys on the fly: suspend/resume/rebind.

RegisterHotKey with hWnd=None is bound to the calling thread, so assignments
can only be removed and installed from inside the hotkey thread - through our
own messages. This test checks that it actually happens rather than merely
compiling.

It is checked by fact: after a rebind the new combination is in registered and
the old one is not; after suspend, registering the same combination FROM THE
OUTSIDE succeeds (so the hotkey really was released) and after resume it fails.
