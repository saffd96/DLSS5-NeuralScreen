"""Win32 window helpers: geometry, the window under the cursor, the list.

Moved out of main.py unchanged. Everything here is pure Windows plumbing -
it takes a window handle and asks the system about it - which is why it was
the first thing that did not belong in a 2200-line main().

The rules these encode are hard-won and the comments carry them:
  * a window's visible bounds are the DWM frame bounds, not GetWindowRect;
  * the desktop (Progman/WorkerW) is not a window you can capture;
  * a window that does not show in the taskbar (owned, tool, DWM-cloaked)
    is a background helper, not something a user means to pick.
