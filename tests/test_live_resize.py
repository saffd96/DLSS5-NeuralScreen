"""A window resize reconfigures the worker instead of replacing it.

Reported as "with a fullscreen video, seeking or changing the quality makes
the picture dim and animate, as if the mode were switching". It was a mode
switch: a browser toggling fullscreen changes its frame from 3840x2100 to
3840x2160, follow_window sees a real resize, and switch_window used to kill
the worker and start another one. Measured on that exact cycle:

    capture closed -> first frame    1.845 s   (before)
                                     0.972 s   (short warm-up)
                                     0.112 s   (reconfigured live)

and the last one raises no veil at all, because no process died.

What this pins, with no worker and no window:

* a resize takes the live path and switch_window is never called;
* it REFUSES when the worker is not the one capturing - the colour then
  still travels through the shared section, whose colour region is sized
  for the window the pipeline was built for, and a larger window would run
  off the end of it;
* a refusal, at either step, falls back to the full rebuild rather than
  leaving the pipeline half-reconfigured;
* the work size, the guides and the motion channel move together - the
  worker reads exactly work_w*work_h*4 bytes of motion, and the two
  drifting apart is what used to hang the program (see do_restart).
