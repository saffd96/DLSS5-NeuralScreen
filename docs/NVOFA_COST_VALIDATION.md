# NVOFA cost validation

## Decision

Do not enable a global cost threshold from these results. Cost rejection reduces
spurious flow in some newly revealed strips, but misses low-cost errors on static
text and rejects correct window motion. No production mask is added by this work.
Threshold 8 below is an illustrative tradeoff, not a recommended setting.

The investigation also found two consecutive guide-processing blocks in
`experimental` at fc6af02. The second block ignored the selected hardware backend,
ran DIS again, and advanced guide history twice. The accompanying main-loop fix
prepares one capture, updates guides once, and preserves the bypass and NVOFA
CPU-skip decisions. It is independent of any cost threshold.

## Reproduction

Hardware: RTX 5080, NVIDIA driver 616.64, Windows build 26200, 2026-09-14.
Build with `cmd /c native\build-host.bat`, then run:

```
runtime\python.exe tests\experiment_nvofa_confidence.py --run
```

The experiment displays a 640x360 window, captures it through WGC, and processes
320x180 gray frames with the production NVOFA FAST backend (grid 4, 8-bit cost).
Its 71 pairs cover a textured window moving horizontally over text (17), a flat
window moving the other way (17), fast motion at 12 gray pixels/frame (11),
diagonal motion (17), and a static control (9). Other movement is 4 gray
pixels/frame horizontally and 2 vertically for the diagonal case.

Every captured frame must match the intended synthetic frame, including a
nearest-reference check to reject stale captures. WGC queues are drained before
advancing either estimator's history. All measured pairs had zero capture MAE.
Each sequence starts with a reset; its expanded GPU motion must be zero. Temporal
hints remain enabled thereafter. The CPU comparison uses the same captured pair
and current `TemporalGuideGenerator`, including its existing static-hypothesis
trust check. No scene-cut reset occurred in these 71 pairs.

Raw NVOFA motion is read back after the production GPU expansion, averaged over
2x2 output pixels and converted to gray-pixel units. Offline filtering zeroes a
vector if the maximum cost of its four bilinear grid neighbours exceeds the
threshold. Tested thresholds: 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 255. The filter is
an offline experiment, not a shader implementation or a runtime timing result.

Moving-window and static-background endpoint error (EPE) have known geometric
ground truth. Two gray pixels around boundaries are excluded. Newly revealed
background has **no visible correspondence** in the prior frame: it is excluded
from EPE and measured separately as the fraction with motion above 0.25 gray
pixels. Zeroing a vector there does not itself prove that NR handles disocclusion
correctly; it is a conservative fallback to be evaluated in rendered output.

## Measurements

Mean per-frame EPE in gray pixels; lower is better. Columns are moving window /
static background. All thresholds and rejection metrics are recorded in
[nvofa-cost-results.json](nvofa-cost-results.json).

| Sequence | Raw NVOFA | Cost > 8 rejected | CPU DIS + trust |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Textured, horizontal | 0.045 / 1.414 | 0.049 / 1.413 | 0.028 / 0.015 |
| Flat, reverse | 0.114 / 1.296 | 0.136 / 1.294 | 3.209 / 0.039 |
| Fast, horizontal | 0.074 / 3.097 | 0.088 / 3.081 | 0.769 / 0.077 |
| Diagonal | 0.033 / 1.831 | 0.050 / 1.778 | 0.042 / 0.032 |
| Static | 0.000 / 0.237 | 0.000 / 0.237 | 0.000 / 0.000 |

Fraction of newly revealed pixels with nonzero motion:

| Sequence | Raw NVOFA | Cost > 8 rejected | CPU DIS + trust |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Textured, horizontal | 98.0% | 27.7% | 98.5% |
| Flat, reverse | 100.0% | 100.0% | 100.0% |
| Fast, horizontal | 99.9% | 25.8% | 98.2% |
| Diagonal | 99.2% | 44.8% | 100.0% |

An aggressive threshold of zero is not a solution either. In the textured
calibration sequence it increases moving-window EPE from 0.045 to 0.394 while
static-background EPE remains 1.138. In the fast holdout it raises moving EPE
from 0.074 to 1.456. Retaining only cost-zero flow therefore still misses errors.

CPU DIS is not a universal winner: flat-window motion is poorly observable and
its trust check rejects much of that movement. NVOFA estimates that window's
translation substantially better. Repeated text also admits ambiguous matches;
the known static background is useful for exposing those errors rather than
assuming a low matching cost means the vector is correct.

## Limits and next experiment

These are vector-level synthetic measurements on one GPU/driver at one gray
resolution, not game FPS or final NR/FG image-quality measurements. Neither an
optimal threshold nor a general confidence probability is established.

**The static-hypothesis candidate was run and declined (R10).** The experiment
now carries the leg: warp the previous frame by the raw NVOFA vector and keep
the vector only where the warped match beats standing still (7x7 window,
margin 0.5 - the CPU trust's own numbers). On the same 71 holdout pairs the
leg removes under 1% of the vectors and moves nothing: textured static EPE
1.4136 -> 1.4134, flat 1.2957 -> 1.2952, static 0.2369 unchanged, while the
moving-window EPE even degrades on the fast sequence (0.0740 -> 0.1466). The
reason is structural: the 8-bit cost already encodes photometric agreement
per vector - the warp test re-measures the same agreement the cost table was
built from, and where cost is wrong the warp is wrong the same way. The CPU
DIS trust earns its keep because DIS has no cost channel at all; NVOFA has
one, so the second test is redundant. No runtime filter ships.

The current CPU trust path provides a useful comparison, including its
flat-region failure.

The official [NVIDIA programming guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/video-technologies/optical-flow-sdk/nvofa-programming-guide/index.html)
defines higher cost as lower reliability and recommends the 8-bit format; it
does not prescribe a universal rejection threshold. The test leaves that question
open rather than promoting one GPU's calibration to a default.

Raw gray, flow, cost, expanded motion, worker logs and per-pair metrics are written
to a unique `_work/nvofa-confidence/<run-id>/` directory. They are local artifacts;
the compact aggregate JSON is committed. No capture readback is added to ordinary
application runs.
