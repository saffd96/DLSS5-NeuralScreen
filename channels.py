"""The worker's side-channels: open one, remember that it is open.

Every channel here has the same shape - send a command, wait for its
acknowledgement, set a flag, and treat a refusal as "carry on without it".
None of them is fatal: the pipeline has a slower path for each one and says
so in the log.

    present    the worker shows the frame in its own window (WNDO)
    dda        the worker captures the screen itself (DDA1)
    wgc        the worker captures ONE window (WGCW)
    gray       the worker writes luminance back for the flow guides (GRAY)
    motion     the motion field travels at flow size, upscaled on the GPU
    out_shm    the result pixels come back through a section, not the pipe

They all take the pipeline state, because the worker, the reader and the
shared memory are REBOUND on every restart - a module that kept its own
references would be one restart away from writing into a dead pipe.

`*_attempted` is not `*_mode`: it means "this worker was already asked, do
not ask again every frame". A restart clears it, which is what the forget_*
functions are for.
