r"""The surround of a window-sized frame is painted, every frame.

In one-window mode the layer is the whole screen while the frame is the
size of the captured window, and show() blits the frame where the window
is. The swap chain is flip-discard: what was on screen last time is not
in the back buffer, so anything show() does not paint is undefined - in
practice the frame from two flips ago. Left alone it reads as a still
photograph of the desktop pinned over the real one, and nothing in it
reacts (user, 13.09).

Three things are pinned here, because two earlier attempts each got one
wrong (d10cfd4/e46a24b blinked - two writers of the layered attributes;
ca1801d stayed magenta - a keyed fill on a layer that was not keyed):

  * every pixel outside the frame is CHROMA_KEY and the frame survives;
  * the layer is ACTUALLY keyed when the frame is smaller than it - the
    missing check that let the magenta screen through;
  * the request is idempotent: a second frame with the same geometry
    must not write the attributes again, and a frame that covers the
    layer must go back to a plain alpha with no key.

The attribute writes are observed through a spy over user32, so "the key
is on" is checked as the call the user's screen would actually obey.
