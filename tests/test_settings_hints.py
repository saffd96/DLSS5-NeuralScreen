"""A hint under a control is one line, and it fits.

The settings page had grown paragraphs: three lines under the Spout2 switch,
two under four more controls. Fourteen controls with explanations under them
stop reading as a list of options - the page becomes a document, and the
thing the user came for is somewhere inside it (user, 12.09).

So the rule, for both pages: the label says what the control is, the hint
adds the ONE thing that is not obvious from the label, and everything that
needs a paragraph has one in the README.

The other half is the same rule the Boost hint was written against and the
menu enforces nowhere: `_draw_toggle`, `_draw_choice` and `_draw_slider` all
put a hint through `_clip`, which TRUNCATES it - silently, with an ellipsis.
Nothing wraps. A translation that grew past the row simply lost its end, in
a language the person who wrote it does not read.

Measured with the real faces, at the real row widths, in all twelve
languages, on both pages - including the controls that only appear in some
states (the resolution slider, which Boost reveals; the monitor and card
pickers, which need more than one of each).
