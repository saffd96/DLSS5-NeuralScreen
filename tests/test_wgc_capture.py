"""The worker captures ONE WINDOW (WGCW) and the pipeline delivers its pixels.

Step 1 of the single-window mode. Until now the worker's only capture source
was Desktop Duplication of the whole screen, which forced the overlay to hide
from screen capture (otherwise the pipeline would capture its own output) -
and that hiding is what stops OBS from seeing the overlay and stops the NVIDIA
App from recording at all.

This test drives the worker directly, with no menu and no main.py loop: it
raises a borderless window of a known colour, hands the worker its HWND, and
demands that the frames coming back out of the pipeline be that window's
content. The capture size in the acknowledgement has to match the window too -
Windows Graphics Capture works in physical pixels, and a mismatch there means
the client would size its textures wrong on a scaled display.

Not covered here: that the capture ignores whatever is drawn on top of the
window. It was measured in the spike (_work/probe_wgc.cpp: a fullscreen
overlay over the target contributes 0% of the captured pixels) and gets its
regression when the overlay itself moves onto the window - there is no second
window to cover the target with at this stage.
