# NeuralScreen

> **HDR fork (experimental):** automatic FP16 desktop/window capture and scRGB output.
> Neural processing uses an SDR proxy; recordings/screenshots remain SDR.
> [Setup, validation and limitations](docs/HDR.md).

**NVIDIA's DLSS 5 neural renderer, applied to your whole Windows desktop in
real time.** Everything on screen — games, video, photos — goes through the
same neural network that DLSS 5 games use, and comes back sharper.

*Everything lives in one menu inside the overlay. The **Before / after wipe**
slider splits the screen down the middle so you can see what the effect is
actually doing.*

## What you need

- **Windows 11**, or Windows 10 - reported working, see the limitations
- **An NVIDIA RTX card.** What works, honestly:

  | Cards | Status |
  |---|---|
  | **RTX 50** (Blackwell) | ✅ works - the officially supported generation |
  | **RTX 40** (Ada) | ✅ works - through the built-in architecture hook |
  | **RTX 30** (Ampere) | ✅ works - restored in v1.5.1 (the universal runtime + spoof 0x1B0, same stack as v1.3.0) |
  | **RTX 20** (Turing) | ❌ cannot run the neural pass at all - below the minimum architecture (DLSS5-Feeder issue #73). See *Trying RTX 20* below. |
  | **Laptops with hybrid graphics (Optimus)** | ✅ works - on the iGPU display the capture falls back to GDI (slower, confirmed on an Acer Nitro with RTX 4050) |

- **Nothing installed.** The release archive brings its own Python.

### Trying RTX 20

Turing is below the minimum architecture - no runtime build makes the
neural pass run on it (0xBAD00001, FeatureNotSupported). The program
starts and the menu works; the picture is not processed.

## Install

1. Download the archive from [Releases](https://github.com/perseval-BLR/DLSS5-NeuralScreen/releases)
   and unpack it anywhere. **Everything is inside** — including NVIDIA's
   `nvngx_dlssnr.dll` (158 MB, too big for GitHub to keep in the repository,
   so it ships in the archive instead).
2. Run **`NeuralScreen.exe`**.

Windows will probably warn you about an unknown publisher the first time — the
program is not signed with a paid certificate. Click *More info* → *Run
anyway*. If you would rather not, `NeuralScreen.vbs` next to it does the same
thing.

There is no installer and nothing is written outside the folder. To remove it,
delete the folder.

> plus a fullscreen overlay is exactly what anti-cheat systems look for.

## Using it

The program sits in the tray (with a taskbar button) and draws over your
desktop. Press **Num2** for the menu. The hotkeys live on the numpad, so
**Num Lock has to be on** - with it off those keys send Insert/End/arrows
instead and nothing happens.

| Key | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Num2** | open / close the menu |
| **Num1** | neural rendering on / off |
| **Num3** | screenshot |
| **Num0** | start / stop recording, with sound |
| **Num4** / **Num6** | processing resolution down / up |
| **Num5** | capture the window under the cursor (see below) |
| **Ctrl+Alt+Q** | quit |

Every key can be reassigned in the menu, under the sliders icon. While the
menu is open it takes the mouse and keyboard, so it works on top of a game.
Closed, clicks go straight through it as if it were not there.

Startup and mode switches do not flash: the overlay appears with the first
real frame, a brief blur-with-spinner covers the pipeline rebuild.

### Whole screen or one window

NeuralScreen renders the whole screen by default. To process one window
instead (a game, a browser), pick **Select window...** in the menu - the
list shows every open window, hovering highlights it on the screen, and
the overlay follows the window. Back to the whole screen: **Fullscreen**
in the menu.

**Num5** is a shortcut for the common case: the window you want is already
open and covers the screen - point at it and press **Num5** to capture it
directly. For anything else, use the window list in the menu.

Minimising the window pauses processing.

## The menu

<table>

<td><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/perseval-BLR/DLSS5-NeuralScreen/main/docs/screenshot-windows.png" alt="Window list" width="380"></td>

</tr>
</table>

The dot next to your graphics card is green when neural rendering is actually
running on it, red when it is not.

The settings worth touching:

- **Profile** — how strong the effect is, from *Faithful* to *Extreme*. The
  default is *Natural* - a faithful, balanced look. The four sliders
  underneath are the same thing in detail. **Save preset** snapshots the
  current slider values under a name (Preset 1, Preset 2, ...) - it appears
  in the Profile list and applies like a built-in profile; **Delete preset**
  removes the active user preset. Dark scenes are handled automatically: an
  adaptive exposure brightens them for the network, so shadows keep their
  detail instead of turning into artifacts.
- **Before / after wipe** — leaves the left part of the screen untouched so
  you can see what the effect is doing. Set it back to 0 when done.
- **Resolution the network runs at** — one slider. At the top it is your whole
  screen, which is the default and the best picture. Every step down hands the
  network a smaller frame: with the slider off the default (full screen) the
  network is already at its best, and every step down means **roughly 50% more
  frames** at 2560×1440 on a 4K screen. The picture stays sharp: the network's
  result is composed onto the pristine 1:1 native frame (a matched residual
  composite), so text, edges and UI keep full resolution while the cheap
  low-res network does the relighting. Look at your own screen and pick a step.
The interface speaks **12 languages** - English, Russian, French, German,
Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Polish, Ukrainian, Chinese, Japanese and Korean.
Pick one under the sliders icon (Language). The menu, the HUD and the alerts
all follow.

Everything else — which monitor, whether the menu opens on launch, starting
with Windows, key assignments — is behind the sliders icon.

## Recording and screenshots

**Num0** records what you see, with system sound, into an MP4 in
`recordings`. **Num3** saves a screenshot. The menu shows up in both if
open - on purpose. While a recording runs, a red dot with a timer sits
in the corner of the screen (off in the settings if you do not want it).
The recording audio passes through a soft limiter, so a loud system mix
cannot clip the track into distortion.

Screenshots open a **Save As** dialog; pick a folder once with
**Screenshot folder...** in the settings and the dialog will start there
every time.

**Record the processed picture externally:**
- **OBS (recommended):** turn on **Spout2 output (OBS)** in the settings
  (RECORDING section). The worker publishes the output as a Spout2 shared
  texture - add a **Spout2 Capture** source in OBS (free plugin) and record
  in AV1 / HEVC / H.264 through NVENC, in any mode. Off by default.
- **NVIDIA App / OBS display capture:** use one-window mode - pick the
  window in the menu (or point at it and press **Num5**), record, then
  switch back to **Fullscreen** when done. The NVIDIA App has no Spout
  input, so this is its only path. In this mode the overlay is
  visible to screen capture; in full-screen mode it hides (the program
  captures the screen itself, and a visible overlay would feed on itself).

## If something is not working

**Nothing appears after launch.** Check `NeuralScreen.log` next to the
program; the most common cause is a missing `native\nvngx_dlssnr.dll`.

**The overlay is invisible in a game.** True fullscreen cannot have anything
drawn over it — a Windows rule. Switch the game to *borderless* or
*windowed fullscreen*.

**The menu pointer is missing or frozen.** A fullscreen game hides the system
cursor; the overlay only shows the system cursor. Borderless fixes it.

**The picture is soft.** Put *Resolution the network runs at* back to the top
of its slider.

**A key does nothing.** Something else claimed it; reassign it in the menu
under the sliders icon.

**The menu is slow in a heavy game.** At 4K the pipeline can take up to a
second per frame; a press may feel lost.

## Known limitations

- **True fullscreen games** cannot have the overlay drawn over them — a Windows rule. Borderless or windowed only.
- **HDR displays:** experimental support in this fork; see [HDR setup and limitations](docs/HDR.md).
- **Windows 10, two NVIDIA cards and a second monitor are experimental** — built or fixed from user logs, none of it tested on the development machine (Windows 11, one card, one monitor); the overlay is drawn on the primary monitor. Reports welcome.
- **Pipeline latency** is 40–60 ms (17-20ms with Boost Mode) — fine interactively, not competitively; **processing resolution is capped at 2560×1440** (the network refuses 4K), output is always your full native resolution.
- **The bundled `nvngx_dlssnr.dll` is the leaked 310.8.0 runtime carrying sm_75/86/89/120 kernels (RTX 20-50)** — see License below.
