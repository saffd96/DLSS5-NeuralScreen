"""Audit F4: a user revive must cancel the armed auto-revive.

Worker fails transiently -> worker_failed=True, next_auto_revive armed
(+30 s), overlay hidden. The user presses Num1 within the window: the
toggle path revives the worker itself, but next_auto_revive stays armed.
If the revived worker's first frame does not arrive inside 30 s, the
top-of-loop auto-revive fires AGAIN on top of the live worker - the
double-init hazard restart_worker's docstring warns about - with a
second "NR ON" alert. In its failure branch, paused stays as the user
set it (False), so the HUD/tray then claim NR ON with no worker.

Expected: at most one revive per failure; a successful user revive
disarms the pending auto-revive. [audit F4]

Both halves are parsed, not sliced by a character count. The old version took
a 1200-character window after a log string, and `st.worker_failed = True` in
the handler it was looking at sits 1396 characters past that anchor - so the
first conjunct was always False, the whole condition was dead, and deleting
`st.paused = True` (the desync the test exists for) still passed.
