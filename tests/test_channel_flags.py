"""Audit F8: teardown+rebuild must reset every channel flag the loop reads.

teardown_pipeline closes the shm; rebuild_pipeline resets the per-worker
flags (present/dda/window/out/motion). gray_active is set/cleared by
channels.sync_gray but NOT reset by either - after a rebuild the loop's
`if st.gray_active:` branch reads a gray section of the NEW shm that the
new worker has not opened (returns None -> one frame with no luminance,
or a shape mismatch through guides' guard).

Expected: the set of flags reset in rebuild_pipeline equals the set the
loop's negotiation block reads. [audit python-core F8]

This used to fail on gray_active alone and merely PRINT the other eight, so
a regression in any of them passed (audit: WEAK). The flags are a set: one
of them missing is the same class of bug, and the print is not a check.
The assertion is now over the whole set.
