"""Frame Generation must run on the bypass present path (issue #104).

A user turned Neural Rendering off and left Frame Generation on. The switch
reached the worker (`[fg] UI: on, 2x` is printed by the worker itself) and the
frame counter kept climbing, but not one line of the presenter's life ever
appeared: no `[fg] Init_Ext`, no `[fg] 2x enabled at`, no `[fg] displayed`.
The package is unambiguous - 3 `[fg]` lines, all three the switch state, 0
lifecycle lines, and 0 failure lines as well: it did not try and fail, it
never started.

The cause was in the presenter path, not in the multiplier or the card:

* `PresentBypass()` called `StopFgPresentation()` unconditionally. That joins
  the presenter thread AND clears `g_fg.history` (`frame_generation.inl`), so
  the runtime was torn down on every bypass frame;
* `g_fg_reset` contained `|| bypass`, so even a live presenter was told to
  reset every frame - and `interpolate` is false whenever `g_fg_reset` is.

Checked here, as source facts (no GPU needed):

1. `PresentBypass()` asks `FgRequested()` and hands the frame to `FgPresent()`,
   and it asks BEFORE any `StopFgPresentation()` - otherwise the presenter is
   stopped before it is ever consulted;
2. the `g_fg_reset` assignment has no `bypass` term: a per-frame reset on a
   whole mode is what made the runtime interpolate nothing. The switch between
   sources must still reset, once;
3. `FRAME_FLAG_BYPASS` is still in the `defer_tail` mask. This one guards the
   opposite direction: pulling bypass into the defer-tail token contract would
   make the worker exit with code 9 and send main into a restart loop;
4. `FgPresent()` picks its export source by `bypass` - the screen shows the raw
   capture on that path, so the export must not keep sending the stale neural
   frame.

Each check is pinned to the line that caused the bug, so each one is provable
by mutation: restore the unconditional stop, put `|| bypass` back, drop the
flag from the mask, or hardcode `v.output`, and the matching check goes red.

The HDR presenter carries the same `&& !bypass` term; it is closed by its own
change, and the honest verification of both needs a GPU (a whole session with
NR off and FG on, asserting `[fg] Init_Ext` and `[fg] displayed` appear) - that
end-to-end check lives in test_frame_generation.py.
