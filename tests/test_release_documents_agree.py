"""The release document set has one meaning in two programs.

`build_release_zip.py` emits four artifacts; the four documents (README and
TECHNICAL, EN and RU) are payload inside the archive but have to be attached
to the GitHub release as separate assets as well. Two independent lists drive
that - `RELEASE_DOCUMENTS` in the builder and in the verifier - and they only
work if they agree:

* if the verifier expects a document the builder does not name, the release
  command in RELEASING.md is short one asset and the verifier fails with
  "release vX is missing asset README.md" AFTER the release is published;
* if the builder names one the verifier does not expect, a correctly published
  release is reported as "carries N asset(s) beyond the release set".

Neither program imports the other (the verifier is deliberately standalone:
it must run against a checkout where the builder may have moved on), so the
agreement is checked here instead of at runtime.

Also checked: the documents are tracked files (an untracked document cannot be
in the tagged blob the verifier compares against), and they are part of the
package payload - the archive the verifier downloads must contain them.

Run:  runtime\\python.exe tests\\test_release_documents_agree.py
